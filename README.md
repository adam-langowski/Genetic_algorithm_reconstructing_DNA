Genetic algorithm implementation - imitating sequencing by hybridization.


Given is the classical DNA spectrum, the length of the original DNA, the length of the used oligonucleotides l=k (for k>=7) and the percentage of positive and negative errors (potentially of both types).


Algorithm reconstructs the sequence using tournament selection as new generations evaluator.
